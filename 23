Time is my nemesis; It burgles my soul.
2     those hours, minutes, and seconds -- pilfer my very being.
Thou dost oppress me incessantly, despite still waters.
3     I shall not rest.
Thou leadest me in paths of [obsessive] punctuality,
    for Time's sake.
4 Yea though I walk through the valley of life in the shadow of clocks,
    there is no respite from thy wrath:
Thou dost mercilessly harrass me;
    thy ticks and thy tocks,
    they torture me.
    
5 Thou preparest a schedule before me
    in the pressure of deadlines;
Thou assaulteth my head with alarums;
    my nerves overflow.
6 Surely the anxiety of thy demands shall haunt me
    all the days of my life,
And I shall stress & fret in the clutches of chronic promptitude
    forever.

To this, I say:  

        "Nevermore"

        Tempis Fug It!

"No Apologies"      >> Donald Trump


23 The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.
2 He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.
3 He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.
4 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.
5 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
6 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.
