Psalm 23King James Version (KJV)
23 The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.
2 He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.
3 He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.
4 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.
5 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
6 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.


The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.
2 
    He makes me lie down in green pastures. He leads me beside still waters.[a]
3 
    He restores my soul. He leads me in paths of righteousness[b]     for his name's sake.
4 
Yea though I must walk through life in the valley of the shadow of
    fearful clocks,
each tick and each tock 
    they torture me.
5 
You prepare a table before me     in the presence of my enemies; you anoint my head with oil;     my cup overflows.
6 
Surely[d] goodness and mercy[e] shall follow me     all the days of my life, and I shall dwell[f] in the house of the Lord     forever.[g]

n Psalm 23, God is using the analogy of sheep and their nature to describe us. Sheep have a natural tendency to wander off and get lost. As believers, we tend to do the same thing. It’s as Isaiah has said: “We all, like sheep, have gone astray, each of us has turned to his own way” (Isaiah 53:6). When sheep go astray, they are in danger of getting lost, being attacked, even killing themselves by drowning or falling off cliffs.
